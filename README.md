# First Series of  C#  👓👓👓🕶 Tasks BY Coach Alex
Based on the  Arrangement of my code file, this elaborate readme is written!💕🙌😎👓🕶👌
## Basic Auth
This implements a **Basic Authentication System** Scope where a user is able to **register** and **Login**. We are basically using a file new.txt as a mock database where the user's details are written to and read from. Feel free to explore😃

## Difference Between Break and Continue using Code
Here, we are basically showing the difference between break and continue by writing asuitable C#👓👓 code. We basically created two separate functions. One implements **Break** and the other implements **Continue**. Both of them use **while loop** to loop through the first ten numbers. You are going to see the power of break and continue at each function. Explore🔥👌
A Pragmatic implementation of our app looks like this:
